# Crime-Analysis-Dashboard-Dynamic-BI-in-Excel
This project transforms a complex, raw crime dataset (sourced from Kaggle) into a fully dynamic and intuitive Business Intelligence (BI) tool using Microsoft Excel. The primary goal was to upgrade the analysis from a static report to a real-time, executive-level decision-support dashboard.
   Key Technical Accomplishments
The dashboard is built upon principles of technical robustness and visualization clarity:

1. Full Interactivity (Core Feature): Achieved 100% dynamic filtering by connecting all 4 Slicers (City, Crime Type, Month, Gender) to all 6 PivotCharts via Report Connections. The entire dashboard updates instantly.

2. Data Preparation: Initial work involved cleaning the raw Kaggle data by handling missing values and standardizing date formats to ensure accurate analysis within the PivotTables.

3. Visualization & UX: Applied professional design principles: moved to a clean, white aesthetic; utilized a dedicated KPI banner; and converted cluttered visualizations into clear, sorted Bar Charts for better comparison.

   Analytical Value
The dashboard enables users to instantly answer critical questions regarding public safety:

-- Geographical Hotspots: Identify which regions are the primary drivers of crime volume.

-- Performance Tracking: Analyze the distribution of different crime types and track overall case closure rates.

-- Temporal Analysis: Use the monthly trends to identify potential seasonal spikes in criminal activity.
