# Crime-Analysis-Dashboard-Dynamic-BI-in-Excel
This project transforms a complex, raw crime dataset (sourced from Kaggle) into a fully dynamic and intuitive Business Intelligence (BI) tool using Microsoft Excel. The primary goal was to upgrade the analysis from a static report to a real-time, executive-level decision-support dashboard.
